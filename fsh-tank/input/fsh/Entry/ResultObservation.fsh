Title: "Result Observation"
Description: """This template represents the results of a laboratory, radiology, or other study performed on a patient.

The result observation includes a statusCode to allow recording the status of an observation. Pending results (e.g., a test has been run but results have not been reported yet) should be represented as active ActStatus.

If code contains a valid non-null LOINC then the xsi:type value SHOULD match the LOINC Scale Part based on the table below:

| LOINC Scale Part     | Value xsi:type |
| -------- | ------- |
| Qn - Quantitative | INT, IVL_INT, MO, IVL_MO, REAL, IVL_REAL, PQ, IVL_PQ, RTO, TS, IVL_TS |
| Ord - Ordinal | CD |
| Nom - Nominal | CD |
| Nar - Narrative | ED, ST |
| OrdQn - Quantitative or Ordinal | CD, INT, IVL_INT, MO, IVL_MO, REAL, IVL_REAL, PQ, IVL_PQ, RTO, TS, IVL_TS |
| Multi - Multi | ED |
| Doc - Document | ED |

For laboratory test codes include codes from http://loinc.org where CLASSTYPE = 1  
Please see https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-us-core-laboratory-test-codes.html used in US Core which has a partial expansion of the 61,898 codes.
