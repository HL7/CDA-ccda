Title: "Transfer Summary"
Description: """This document describes constraints on the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) header and body elements for a Transfer Summary. The Transfer Summary standardizes critical information for exchange of information between providers of care when a patient moves between health care settings. 

Standardization of information used in this form will promote interoperability; create information suitable for reuse in quality measurement, public health, research, and for reimbursement."""
