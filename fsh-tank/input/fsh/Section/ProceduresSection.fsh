Title: "Procedures Section"
Description: """This section describes all historical or current interventional, surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures or treatments pertinent to the patient at the time the document is generated. The section should include notable procedures, but can contain all procedures for the period of time being summarized.

Subsections MAY be used to partition the entries into different categories. For example, a subsection with the Loinc code of 18748-4 (Diagnostic Imaging) MAY be used to group DI procedures. Similarly 11502-2 (Clinical Laboratory) MAY be used to group laboratory procedures."""
