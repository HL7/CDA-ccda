# Overview

This is the repository for C-CDA R2.2.

The repository contains all artifacts required to publish C-CDA R2.2 using the FHIR IG Publisher.

The initial commits are based on exports of the C-CDA R2.1 implementation guide from Trifolia Workbench (https://trifolia.lantanagroup.com).

The artifacts exported from Trifolia Workbench are going to be updated to include changes that would be applied for C-CDA R2.2.

In C-CDA R2.2, not only will improvements/enhancements/issues be addressed to the implementation guide's content, but the underlying publishing framework used to publish C-CDA will change.
