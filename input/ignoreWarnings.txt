# 01 CDA Schematron generation parameters that are noted as unknown by the IG publisher
Unknown Parameters: [value-set-limit=1000, parent-template-id=2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22]

# 02 Deliberate decision around fixed/pattern which results in warnings

# 03 IG Publisher issue - Grahame to fix: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/198221-cda.2Fpublish/topic/Invariant.20expression.20error
http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ElementDefinition#eld-21

# 04 Inherent collections where collection is limited to a single value so the warning is fine
%The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'item.country.xmlText%
%The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'value.unit%
%The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'value.code%

# 05 Deprecated value set that is used by CDA and inherited by C-CDA
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# 06 xsi:type information - firing on templates with constrained type, but still required in CDA
xsi:type is unnecessary at this point

# 08 Each slice is optional, so the maximum still applies
The slice definition for Observation.value has a maximum of 1 but the slices add up to a maximum of 2. Check that this is what is intended

# 11 These are template IDs that are embedded in other templates and are not an individual template.  The validator can not find these templates and warns us about them.
