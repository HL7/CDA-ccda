            <description value="This chapter contains the section-level templates referenced by one or more of the document types of this consolidated guide. These templates describe the purpose of each section and the section-level constraints.&#xA;&#xA;Section-level templates are always included in a document. One and only one of each section type is allowed in a given document instance. Please see the document context tables to determine the sections that are contained in a given document type. Please see the conformance verb in the conformance statements to determine if it is required (SHALL), strongly recommended (SHOULD), or optional (MAY).&#xA;&#xA;Each section-level template contains the following:&#xA;* Template metadata (e.g., templateId, etc.)&#xA;* Description and explanatory narrative&#xA;* LOINC section code&#xA;* Section title&#xA;* Requirements for a text element&#xA;* Entry-level template names and Ids for referenced templates (required and optional)&#xA;&#xA;Narrative Text&#xA;&#xA;The text element within the section stores the narrative to be rendered, as described in the CDA R2 specification, and is referred to as the CDA narrative block.&#xA;&#xA;The content model of the CDA narrative block schema is handcrafted to meet requirements of human readability and rendering. The schema is registered as a MIME type (text/x-hl7-text+xml), which is the fixed media type for the text element.&#xA;&#xA;As noted in the CDA R2 specification, the document originator is responsible for ensuring that the narrative block contains the complete, human readable, attested content of the section. Structured entries support computer processing and computation and are not a replacement for the attestable, human-readable content of the CDA narrative block. The special case of structured entries with an entry relationship of &quot;DRIV&quot; (is derived from) indicates to the receiving application that the source of the narrative block is the structured entries, and that the contents of the two are clinically equivalent.&#xA;&#xA;As for all CDA documents—even when a report consisting entirely of structured entries is transformed into CDA—the encoding application must ensure that the authenticated content (narrative plus multimedia) is a faithful and complete rendering of the clinical content of the structured source data. As a general guideline, a generated narrative block should include the same human readable content that would be available to users viewing that content in the originating system. Although content formatting in the narrative block need not be identical to that in the originating system, the narrative block should use elements from the CDA narrative block schema to provide sufficient formatting to support human readability when rendered according to the rules defined in Section Narrative Block (§ 4.3.5 ) of the CDA R2 specification.&#xA;&#xA;By definition, a receiving application cannot assume that all clinical content in a section (i.e., in the narrative block and multimedia) is contained in the structured entries unless the entries in the section have an entry relationship of &quot;DRIV&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Additional specification information for the CDA narrative block can be found in the CDA R2 specification in sections 1.2.1, 1.2.3, 1.3, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 4.3.4.2, and 6."/>

Entry templates contain constraints that are required for conformance.&#xA;&#xA;Entry-level templates are always in sections.&#xA;&#xA;Each entry-level template description contains the following information:&#xA;* Key template metadata (e.g., template identifier, etc.)&#xA;* Description and explanatory narrative.&#xA;* Required CDA acts, participants and vocabularies.&#xA;* Optional CDA acts, participants and vocabularies.&#xD;&#xA;Several entry-level templates require an effectiveTime:&#xA;&#xA;The effectiveTime of an observation is the time interval over which the observation is known to be true. The low and high values should be as precise as possible, but no more precise than known. While CDA has multiple mechanisms to record this time interval (e.g., by low and high values, low and width, high and width, or center point and width), this guide constrains most to use only the low/high form. The low value is the earliest point for which the condition is known to have existed. The high value, when present, indicates the time at which the observation was no longer known to be true. The full description of effectiveTime and time intervals is contained in the CDA R2 normative edition.&#xA;&#xA;Provenance in entry templates:&#xA;&#xA;In this version of Consolidated CDA (C-CDA), we have added a &quot;SHOULD&quot; Author constraint on several entry-level templates. Authorship and Author timestamps must be explicitly asserted in these cases, unless the values propagated from the document header hold true.&#xA;&#xA;ID in entry templates:&#xA;&#xA;Entry-level templates may also describe an id element, which is an identifier for that entry. This id may be referenced within the document, or by the system receiving the document. The id assigned must be globally unique."/>

It serves as a blueprint shared by all Care Team Members (including the patient, their caregivers and providers), to guide the patient'ss care. A Care Plan integrates multiple interventions proposed by multiple providers and disciplines for multiple conditions.&#xA;&#xA;A Care Plan represents one or more Plan(s) of Care and serves to reconcile and resolve conflicts between the various Plans of Care developed for a specific patient by different providers. While both a plan of care and a care plan include the patients life goals and require Care Team Members (including patients) to prioritize goals and interventions, the reconciliation process becomes more complex as the number of plans of care increases. The Care Plan also serves to enable longitudinal coordination of care.&#xA;&#xA;The CDA Care Plan represents an instance of this dynamic Care Plan at a point in time. The CDA document itself is NOT dynamic.&#xA;&#xA;Key differentiators between a Care Plan CDA and CCD (another snapshot in time document):&#xA;There are 2 required sections:&#xA;*    Health Concerns&#xA;*    Interventions&#xA;&#xA;There are 2 optional sections:&#xA;*    Goals&#xA;*    Outcomes&#xA;	Provides the ability to identify patient and provider priorities with each act&#xA;	Provides a header participant to indicate occurrences of Care Plan review&#xA;&#xA;A care plan document can include entry references from the information in these sections to the information (entries) in other sections.&#xA;&#xA;Please see Volume 1 of this guide to view a Care Plan Relationship diagram and story board."/>

            <description value="This document type was originally based on the Continuity of Care Document (CCD) Release 1.1 which itself was derived from HITSP C32 and CCD Release 1.0.&#xA;&#xA;The Continuity of Care Document (CCD) represents a core data set of the most relevant administrative, demographic, and clinical information facts about a patient's healthcare, covering one or more healthcare encounters. It provides a means for one healthcare practitioner, system, or setting to aggregate all of the pertinent data about a patient and forward it to another to support the continuity of care.  &#xA;&#xA;The primary use case for the CCD is to provide a snapshot in time containing the germane clinical, demographic, and administrative data for a specific patient. The key characteristic of a CCD is that the ServiceEvent is constrained to &quot;PCPR&quot;. This means it does not function to report new ServiceEvents associated with performing care. It reports on care that has already been provided. The CCD provides a historical tally of the care over a range of time and is not a record of new services delivered.&#xA;&#xA;More specific use cases, such as a Discharge Summary, Transfer Summary, Referral Note, Consultation Note, or Progress Note, are available as alternative documents in this guide."/>

            <description value="A Medication Activity describes substance administrations that have actually occurred (e.g., pills ingested or injections given) or are intended to occur (e.g., &quot;take 2 tablets twice a day for the next 10 days&quot;). Medication activities in &quot;INT&quot; mood are reflections of what a clinician intends a patient to be taking. For example, a clinician may intend that a patient be administered Lisinopril 20 mg PO for blood pressure control. If what was actually administered was Lisinopril 10 mg., then the Medication activities in the &quot;EVN&quot; mood would reflect actual use.&#xA;&#xA;A moodCode of INT is allowed, but it is recommended that the Planned Medication Activity (V2) template be used for moodCodes other than EVN if the document type contains a section that includes Planned Medication Activity (V2) (for example a Care Plan document with Plan of Treatment, Intervention, or Goal sections).&#xA;&#xA;At a minimum, a Medication Activity shall include an effectiveTime indicating the duration of the administration (or single-administration timestamp). Ambulatory medication lists generally provide a summary of use for a given medication over time - a medication activity in event mood with the duration reflecting when the medication started and stopped. Ongoing medications will not have a stop date (or will have a stop date with a suitable NULL value). Ambulatory medication lists will generally also have a frequency (e.g., a medication is being taken twice a day). Inpatient medications generally record each administration as a separate act.&#xA;&#xA;The dose (doseQuantity) represents how many of the consumables are to be administered at each administration event. As a result, the dose is always relative to the consumable and the interval of administration. Thus, a patient consuming a single &quot;metoprolol 25mg tablet&quot; per administration will have a doseQuantity of &quot;1&quot;, whereas a patient consuming &quot;metoprolol&quot; will have a dose of &quot;25 mg&quot;."/>

In the Care Planning workflow, the judgment about how well the person is progressing towards the goal is based on the observations made about the status of the patient with respect to interventions performed in the pursuit of achieving that goal.&#xA;&#xA;Often thought of as an &quot;actual outcome&quot;, the Outcome Observation may be related to goals, progression toward goals, and the associated interventions. For example, an observation outcome of a blood oxygen saturation level of 95% is related to the goal of &quot;Maintain Pulse Ox greater than 92&quot;, which in turn is related to the health concern of respiratory insufficiency and the problem of pneumonia. The template makes use of the Entry Reference (templateId:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.122) to reference the interventions and goals defined elsewhere in the Care Plan CDA instance."/>
