                <p>This implementation guide is a <strong>prototype publication</strong> of the C-CDA R2.1 June 2019 with errata publication (Errata #5) using FHIR StructureDefinition (SD) tooling, to produce this SD replica of the June 2019 errata package.</p>
                
                <p>This publication is for community review prior to the next ballot of C-CDA (January 2024) which is intended to be produced using the FHIR StructureDefinition (SD) tooling.</p>
                
                <p>The C-CDA R2.1 June 2019 with errata pdf publication (Errata #5) has been superseded by the current official published version of C-CDA R2.1 September 2022 (errata #7) pdf publication, which should be used for new or updated implementations until superseded by a future version of C-CDA.</p>
