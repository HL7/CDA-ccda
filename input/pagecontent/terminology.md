This page lists all the ValueSets, CodeSystems, and ConceptMaps defined as part of the Consolidated CDA Implementation Guide.

Value sets that include inactive or deprecated codes must be used with caution. Inactive and deprecated codes should not be used for data creation. Non-active codes are of particular use when the value set is used for historical queries. Validation likely should accept non-active codes. Also implementers should be aware that some code systems do not provide access to non-active codes for current expansions and if non-active codes are needed they may be available in prior expansions available via terminology services.
